/*
This is not junk!

This class is supposed to provide an interface for the outside-of-graphicsengine world
for geometry creation, and adding it to the database loaded by the resource manager.
The resource manager should also use this class for loading geometries.

Not very necessary at the moment, but implement it, because it'll be useful in the future.
