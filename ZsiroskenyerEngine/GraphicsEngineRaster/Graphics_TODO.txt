-- visual quality algorithms
1. shadow mapping (at least some basic)
2. order-independent transparency

-- engine structure & resource handling
1. different g-buffer shaders
	- different if has feature or not (is there normal map?, cutout map?)
	- proper processing of input material
		(diffuse color vs. diffuse texture)
	- different vertex formats
2. lightpass shaders
	- support for most physical material properties
		-> multiple shaders (when to use which?!)
		-> one uber shader (won't it be slow as fuck?!)
3. instanced rendering
	- what type of instanced rendering...?
	- does the graphics api handle it implicitly...?
	- anyway, we're gonna implement it if 4 cores are not enough!
